Amazon_Scraper- This project will scrape the item name and its price from the amazon site every hour(its updated). We will then make a dataset to do real-time analysis on amazon product prices each hour.

This can then be used to gain insights about how amazon's products fair each hour.

Please note if you want to run this script 24/7 USE AWS or Use Cron Job or Schduled task on Windows. I have used Cron job to run this script.
